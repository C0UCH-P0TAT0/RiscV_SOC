# 🖥️ VSD RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program

---
## 📖 Program Overview
This repository documents my progress and learnings from the **VSD RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program**. This is a landmark open-source silicon design initiative in India that guides participants through the complete chip design lifecycle.

Key highlights of the program include:
* **Objective**: To take a digital design from a concept (**RTL**) to a final, manufacturable layout (**GDSII**).
* **Technology**: The entire flow is based on the **SkyWater 130nm PDK** and a suite of open-source EDA tools.
* **Curriculum**: Over **10 weeks**, the program provides intensive, hands-on training in digital design, synthesis, physical design, and tapeout procedures.

## 🎯 My Goals for This Program
Through this program, I aim to achieve the following:
* Learn the end-to-end SoC design flow using exclusively open-source EDA tools.
* Gain practical, hands-on experience in converting a design from RTL to a final GDSII layout.
* Actively contribute to India’s growing semiconductor ecosystem.
* Successfully tape out a functional silicon chip as a key outcome of the VSD program.
